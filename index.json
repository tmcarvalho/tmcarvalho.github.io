One of the linchpins for efficiency and accuracy in machine learning is data utility. However, when it contains personal information, full access may be restricted due to laws and regulations aiming to protect individuals' privacy. Therefore, data owners must ensure that any data shared guarantees such privacy. Removal or transformation of private information (de-identification) are among the most common techniques. Intuitively, one can anticipate that reducing detail or distorting information would result in losses for model predictive performance. However, previous work concerning classification tasks using de-identified data generally demonstrates that predictive performance can be preserved in specific applications. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the existence of a trade-off between data privacy and predictive performance in classification tasks. We leverage a large set of privacy-preserving techniques and learning algorithms to provide an assessment of re-identification ability and the impact of transformed variants on predictive performance. Unlike previous literature, we confirm that the higher the level of privacy (lower re-identification risk), the higher the impact on predictive performance, pointing towards clear evidence of a trade-off.","tags":[],"title":"Towards a Data Privacy-Predictive Performance Trade-off","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tânia Carvalho","Nuno Moniz","Pedro Faria","Luís Antunes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"ff6a19061a984819d30c916886db56ef","permalink":"https://tmcarvalho.github.io/publication/example/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/example/","section":"publication","summary":"Faced with the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, and to better understand and contain the disease’s spread, health organisations increased the collaboration with other organisations sharing health data with data scientists and researchers. Data analysis assists such organisations in providing information that could help in decision-making processes. For this purpose, both national and regional health authorities provided health data for further processing and analysis. Shared data must comply with existing data protection and privacy regulations. Therefore, a robust de-identification procedure must be used, and a re-identification risk analysis should also be performed. De-identified data embodies state-of-the-art approaches in Data Protection by Design and Default because it requires the protection of direct and indirect identifiers (not just direct). This article highlights the importance of assessing re-identification risk before data disclosure by analysing a data set of individuals infected by Covid-19 that was made available for research purposes. We stress that it is highly important to make this data available for research purposes and that this process should be based on the state of the art methods in Data Protection by Design and by Default. Our main goal is to consider different re-identification risk analysis scenarios since the information on the intruder side is unknown. Our conclusions show that there is a risk of identity disclosure for all of the studied scenarios. For one, in particular, we proceed to an example of a re-identification attack. The outcome of such an attack reveals that it is possible to identify individuals with no much effort.","tags":[],"title":"Fundamental privacy rights in a pandemic state","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tânia Carvalho","Nuno Moniz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"db2045ab803a6b08c2facf151ea52efe","permalink":"https://tmcarvalho.github.io/publication/ida/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ida/","section":"publication","summary":"Privacy-preservation has become an essential concern in many data mining applications since the emergence of legal obligations to protect personal data. Thus, the notion of Privacy-Preserving Data Mining emerged to allow the extraction of knowledge from data without violating the privacy of individuals. Several transformation techniques have been proposed to protect the privacy of individuals. However, their application does not guarantee a null risk of an individual being re-identified. Furthermore, and most importantly, for this paper, the application of such techniques may have a considerable impact on the utility of data and their use in predictive and descriptive tasks. In this paper, we present a study to provide key insights concerning the impact of privacy-preserving techniques in predictive performance. Unlike previous work, our main conclusions point towards a noticeable impact of privacy-preservation techniques in predictive performance.","tags":[],"title":"The Compromise of Data Privacy in Predictive Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
